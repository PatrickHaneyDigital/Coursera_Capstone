    "The data for this project will be derived from Geopy, a popular Python Geography library, along with the FourSquare API's exploration endpoint, and a list of Phoenix neighborhoods from Wikipedia. This data will consist of the coordinates and names of all of Phoenix, Arizona's neighborhoods; the coordinates of the center of the city itself; and lists containing details on up to 100 venues per neighborhood.\n",

The resulting dataframe will be used for k-means clustering with the scikit-learn library, which will help with identifying the neighborhoods that will be more suitable for the 50+ aged community.\n",
